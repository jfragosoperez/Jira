Configuring connector

- In order to run these notebooks you will need a Jira account which can be hosted by Atlassian or on your own. In the later case your jira installation URL must have empty path.
- Specify your Jira username and password in the Authentication tab of the HTTP Request Configuration dialog. Alternatively, you may set corresponding attributes right in the XML file.


Running connector
